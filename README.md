<h1>SIV</h1>
SIV or else Simple Image Viewer is a small program writen in Java that enables the user to view images. This app is really simple and it is mostly directed to Linux users that access their files through the CLI and want an image viewer that can accept command line arguments. Of course this does not mean that the app does not have a GUI that enables the user to pick and view an image. 
<h1>This is work in progress</h1> 
In this version 1.0.0 the app only supports the basic functionallity of an image viewer. I will support and continue to develop this project for the foreseeable future.
<br>
<br>
<b>Coming in the next few versions:</b>
<ul>
<li>Light theme</li>
<li>Zoom functionallity</li>
<li>Navigating a folder through the app</li> 
</ul>
<h1>Using SIV</h1>
After intalling SIV you can view images with two ways 
<ol>
<li>You can start SIV and pick an image using the GUI provided.<br><code>java -jar imageViewer.jar</code></li>
<li>You can provide the path of the image as an CLI argument and SIV will open the image<br><code>java -jar imageViewer.jar /path/to/image</code></li>
</ol>
<h1>Installation method</h1> 
clone the repository and add the imageViewer.jar file to PATH.
